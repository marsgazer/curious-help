## Image Address Copy and Paste

### If you have one URL

If you have an URL of only one image, `x3dview` will try to find the other image, so that you will see a stereo pair.
The automatic search is file name-based.

copy-paste-single.mp4

### Copy and Paste using a thumbnail

copy-paste.mp4

### If you have two URLs

paste-two.mp4
