# How Do I Use X3D Viewer?


## Image Address Copy and Paste

### If you have one URL

If you have an URL of only one image, `x3dview` will try to find the other image, so that you will see a stereo pair.
The automatic search is file name-based.

### If you have two URLs

paste-two.mp4

### Copy and Paste instead of Drag-and-Drop

Just like you can drag-and-drop a thumbnail image, you can copy-and-paste the address of a thumbnail image,
`x3dview` will load the corresponding full-scale image,
and if you select "Paste & Go (Both Panes)", `x3dview` will try to find the other image and show you a stereo pair.

## Making a stereo pair from any other source (e.g. the Opportunity rover)

## How do I find an artifact?

The Martian nature _loves_ right angles, parallel lines, and bizarre shapes.
It is relatively easy to find something that looks strange.
