# Use X3D Viewer

## Drag and Drop

in the browser.

Run `x3dview`.

Drag an image thumbnail from the browser's window, and drop it onto the x3dview window.

***TODO video***


Note: Drag-and-Drop does not work under Linux with Chrome-based browsers. This is not a `x3dview` bug, it is either Chrome or Java bug.
(It's unlikely that they are going to fix it because each of them has got somebody else to blame. So do I, but no Java program
can see what is dragged from Chrome under Linux.)


## If you see only one image

Two reasons:

1. There is no pair for that image
2. The checkbox "DnD to Both" is not checked. (You can toggle it with Alt+B if you prefer keyboard.)


## Copy and Paste
